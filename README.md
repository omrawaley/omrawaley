### 👋 Hey, welcome!

My name's Om Rawaley, and I am immensely passionate about computer engineering, design, and entrepreneurship. 

I'm building a portable STEM video game console named **PocketByte** that aims to help STEM learners get into computer engineering and give computer hobbyists a fun, creative platform to bring their ideas to life. [**Check it out!**](https://pocketbyte.co)
